# Image Inpainting

This project focuses on restoring missing parts of images using deep learning techniques like U-Net and Context Encoder. It uses CIFAR-10 dataset for training and includes image inpainting and super-resolution enhancements via SRGAN.

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Masking and reconstructing missing image parts
- Model comparison: U-Net vs Context Encoder
- Applied SRGAN for super-resolution

## ðŸš€ Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run training/inference scripts as needed

## ðŸ§  Technologies
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- GANs (Context Encoder, SRGAN)
- CIFAR-10 dataset
